The choice is yours, I'll rate the difficulty and scale later on.
0. Quoting automation(excel itself should do it, index + match? with drop down)
1. Scheduling(gent chart? excel linear programming?Man-month allocation)
2. Confirmation letter control (letter creation automation for Arthurization and verification)
3. The shape of working paper (for man-month estimation and progress visualization)
4. Document management for full document digitalization (Mapping protocal is the key/ api)
5. Financial(/tax) report creation automation(full excel / excel + word)
6. Roll over challenge
